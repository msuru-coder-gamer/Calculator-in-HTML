# Calculator in HTML
This code is for a simple HTML calculator.
Wanna see it in action? Then go here: https://msuru.000webhostapp.com/calculator/index.html

WARNING: IF YOU ARE NOT A NERD, DO NOT READ THE REST OF THIS DOCUMENT. Seriously, just don't.

# How it works:

In the index.html, every button executes a JS function when clicked. There are 4 functions, those being num(), sym(), equals() and decimal(). 

The number buttons execute the num() function in this format: button 1 does num("1"), button 2 does num("2") and so on.

The symbol buttons execute the sym() funtion in this format: button + does sym("+"), button - does sym("-") and so on.

HOWEVER, the = button executes the equals() function respectively, just like how the . button executes the decimal() function.

Every function is stored in the calcultor-scripting.js file, along with some variables so it can actually work.

And yea, thats about it. if you want to see the code and mess around with it too, then download this as a .zip
